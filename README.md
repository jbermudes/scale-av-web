The website is hosted from the gh-pages branch.  You may make your own static HTML and CSS files.  Or you can write it in Markdown by making sure the following boilerplate is at the top of the file:

'''
---
title: <your title>
---
'''

GitHub will render the Markdown as HTML if it sees the above Markdown in the beginning of the file.  

The text files may be edited directly on GitHub.  Otherwise, you can cloen it to your local machine and use your favorite editor.
