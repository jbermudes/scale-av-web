The source files for the [scale-av minimalist website](http://scale-av.github.io/scale-av-web/) is on this gh-pages branch. You may make your own static HTML and CSS files.  

If you prefer to use Markdown as your source file, make sure you make the title the first thing in the file:

```
---
title: <your title>
---
```

GitHub will render the Markdown as HTML if it sees the above Markdown in the beginning of the file. This applies to the website when it is viewed through [http://scale-av.github.io/scale-av-web/](http://scale-av.github.io/scale-av-web/) URL 

The text files may be edited directly on GitHub.  Otherwise, you can clone it to your local machine and use your favorite editor.
