SCALE A/V is the team that handles A/V for the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://socallinuxexpo.org), an open source conference.  

We consist of volunteers.  

We are currently working on SCALE 12x, which will be on Feb 21-23, 2014 at the LAX Hilton.

If you are interested in volunteering with us, 

 - Sign up [here](http://bit.ly/L0vGSa) at your earliest convenience so we can get a good idea of what our staffing will be and whether we need to heavily recruit for certain time slots.
 - Sign up for the [scale-av mailing list](https://lists.linuxfests.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/scale-av).That is where A/V-related discussions occur and where announcements will be made.  There will be morfrequent announcements as we get closer to SCALE.
 - Bookmark this page.  It will be a centralized place to direct people to current scale-av plans and activities.  We will be posting more information as we figure out logistical and technical issues.


There are many [volunteer opportunities](https://github.com/scale-av/scale-av-web/wiki/Volunteer-opportunities) before and during the conference.
