===========================

SCALE A/V is the team that handles A/V for the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://socallinuxexpo.org), an open source conference.  

We consist of volunteers.  The main perks for volunteers include free admission to SCALE, learning new things, getting the bird's eye view of the conference.  And meals are covered for your shifts.

We are currently working on SCALE 12x, which will be at the LAX Hilton on the weekend of Feb 21-23, 2014.

There are many volunteer opportunities ([see wiki](https://github.com/scale-av/scale-av-web/wiki/Volunteer-opportunities)) before, during, and after the conference.

Please keep an eye on the 
 - [video-capture github wiki](https://github.com/scale-av/video-capture/wiki)

volunteer timeline
------------------
 - Most of the before-SCALE activities involve software development and hardware hacking in addition to the usual planning.  
 - Feb 20 (Thu),  we will be setting up the conference rooms and the A/V command center.  
 - Feb 21-23 (Fri-Sun),  we will be focused on live video and audio production and troubleshooting.  
 - Feb 23 (Sun), once the conference is over,  we could use all the help we can get for tear down.  
 - After, we will have a post-mortem and finish up with any video editing tasks needed to get all the videos uploaded to Youtube.

volunteer signup
----------------
If you are interested in volunteering with us, 

 - Sign up [here](http://bit.ly/L0vGSa) at your earliest convenience so we can get a good idea of what our staffing will be and whether we need to heavily recruit for certain time slots.
 - Sign up for the [scale-av mailing list](https://lists.linuxfests.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/scale-av).  This is we discuss things relating to A/V and where announcements will be made.  It will get busier as we get closer to SCALE.   Please feel free to ask questions and contribute your ideas.  Don't let Feb 21 or 22nd be the first time we hear from you.
 - Bookmark [this page](http://scale-av.github.io/scale-av-web/).  It will be a centralized place to direct people to current scale-av plans and activities.  We will be posting more information as we figure out logistical and technical issues.
